/*
    Exercise 1-11

    How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
    likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
*/

I would test the program by running it on a file/input that has a few lines,
where in each line I would have a few words, spaces, tabs, and different
characters.

Input that has a potential to cause errors would contain special symbols such
as: n- and m-dash; words that break to the next line; arithmetic;
abbreviations; and so on.
