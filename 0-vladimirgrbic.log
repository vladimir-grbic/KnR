I forgot to log the previous session which was about 2 hours long.

# Section 1.5

Any character (whether on the keyboard or screen) is like everything else
stored internally just as a bit pattern. 'char' is the type specifically meant
to store such character data, but an 'int' can be used as well.

That must be the case if one wants to store EOF character, which itself is an
integer (defined in <stdio.h>).

An assignment can appear as a prat of a larger expression.

Eg.
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)

The parentheses around the assignment are necessary because the
precedence of != is higher than that of =.

%ld is the conversion specification used for long ints
%f is both for float and double

NOTE: '\n' = integer value equal to the numerical value of \n in the machine's
      character set. Eg. \n = 10, A = 65 (ASCII)
      Also note that `\n` is a single character and in expression is JUST AN
      INTEGER, while "\n" is a string that happens to contain only one
      character.

I finished Exercise 1-10.
